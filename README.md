useMemo() hook uses Cache so that we dont need to render the value again and again.
useMemo is used for Performance.


u Get an error that To many re-renders
useEffect has to be used.


When we use Redux Toolkit the state updates but when refreshed or move to the new page using the url it sets to the original state value.
To overcome the state value when redirected to the new url Use Link form react router dom.
Also to retain the state use local storage.
Also we can use Redux Persist. ------Redux-persist is also easy to use. Or we can directly use Local storage.
